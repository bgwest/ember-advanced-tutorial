# ember-advanced-tutorial

A fairly lengthy, but good, tutorial that weaves you through the basic to intermediate concepts of ember. All along the way, I have found that as we write code we also write a test for it. I have liked the strategic approach that it takes.

# How I generated this repo boilerplate

I wanted to do this tutorial in Typescript so that I could keep those skills fresh and up the challenge a little. Since my process for creating a base ember app in Typescript was being parsed from a few different sources, I thought it would be nice that documented.

I liked that the `init` command let you do your own git repo/process. Many of the tutorials and doc examples recommend `ember new`, which adds a `.git` setup for you.

**Update/Amendment**:  
It looks like you can also run `ember new` with `--skip-git ` or `-sg` for short.

1. In GitHub, I created a new empty repo called: "ember-advanced-tutorial"  
(**note:** _if you already haven't, ember must be globally installed with npm first_)  
2. Locally, I cloned that repo, `cd`'d into it, and then ran: `ember init`  
3. Added all generated files to git, then pushed up
4. created a new branch for typescript/vscode configs
5. ran ` ember install ember-cli-typescript@latest`
6. ran `ember g component -gc welcome` (**note:** _I could not get this to command to generate any ts files..._)
7. Add eslint/prettier or any further tsconfig if needed
8. For better accessibility, add your preferred lang via the lang attribute in the html tag inside `app/index.html` (e.g. `<html lang="en">`) (_**note:** happens automatically when using `ember new` (referenced here:_ <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/orientation/#toc_creating-a-new-ember-app-with-ember-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#toc_creating-a-new-ember-app-with-ember-cli</a>))

### More on the welcome component generation

So far I have been using the `-ts` flag version of `ember generate component` for better better insight.

full command example:  
`ember g component -ts -gc welcome`

Adding the `-ts` flag signals that you want to create a typescript version of this component. If a typescript version is available, it will be created. If a typescript version is not available, then a warning will be shown in your console. 

Inside `.ember-cli`, I currently have `isTypeScriptProject` set to `true`. And as mentioned earlier, for good measure, I also pass the `-ts` flag when running generate. I am currently all the way up through the end of Part 1 of the Super Rental Tutorial, and with both of the above configurations passed, I still have not had 1 set of the cli commands generate a typescript file.

My current guess is either I've set something up incorrectly or what is actually generated in typescript with `ember generate component` is limited. I'm not entirely sure at this time, but I have since saved a few web articles to read more about `ember-cli-typescript` after I finish this tutorial series.

## for the curious (terminal output of `ember g component`)

Example output without `-ts` flag

```
bgwest:ember-advanced-tutorial bgwest$ ember g component -gc welcome
installing component
  identical app/components/welcome.js
  identical app/components/welcome.hbs
installing component-test
  identical tests/integration/components/welcome-test.js
```

Example output with `-ts` flag:

```
bgwest-mac:ember-advanced-tutorial bgwest$ ember g component -gc -ts welcome
installing component
You passed the '--typescript' flag but there is no TypeScript blueprint available. A JavaScript blueprint will be generated instead.
