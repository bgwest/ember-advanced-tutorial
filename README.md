# How I generated this repo boilerplate

Since my process for creating an base level ember app is being parsed from a few different sources, I thought it would be nice to have them in one place incase I need to do this again.

I liked that the `init` command let you do your own git repo/process. Almost all the docs recommend `ember new`, which adds a `.git` setup for you.

### Please note

Please note that my README here, at least at this time, is intended for helping me remember the ember-cli better. What I understand and assert is subject to change as I learn more. If anyone is following along, I felt responsible to share that friendly fair warning.

**Update/Amendment**:  
It looks like you can also run `ember new` with `--skip-git ` or `-sg` for short.

1. In GitHub, created a new empty repo called "ember-advanced-tutorial" .
2. Locally, when in dir of choice, ran my global ember command: `ember init`
3. Added all generated files to GitHub and pushed it up
4. created a new branch for typescript/vscode configs
5. ran ` ember install ember-cli-typescript@latest`
6. ran `ember g component -gc welcome` (**note:** _I could not get this to command to generate any ts files..._)
7. Add eslint/prettier or any further tsconfig if needed
8. For better accessibility, add your preferred lang via the lang attribute in the html tag inside `app/index.html` (e.g. `<html lang="en">`) (_**note:** happens automatically when using `ember new` (referenced here:_ <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/tutorial/part-1/orientation/#toc_creating-a-new-ember-app-with-ember-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#toc_creating-a-new-ember-app-with-ember-cli</a>))

### More on the welcome component generation

I plan to use the `-ts` flag version of `ember generate component` for better better insight (`ember g component -ts -gc welcome`). It tells you whether or not templates are available for what you are trying to create. As of end of part 1 of the super rental tutorial, I have not had 1 set of the cli commands generate a typescript file. My current guess is either I've set something up incorrectly or what is acturally generated in typescript with `ember generate component` limited. I'm not entirely sure at this time.

Example output with ts flag:

```
bgwest:ember-advanced-tutorial bgwest$ ember g component -gc welcome
installing component
  identical app/components/welcome.js
  identical app/components/welcome.hbs
installing component-test
  identical tests/integration/components/welcome-test.js
```

Example output without ts flag

```
bgwest-mac:ember-advanced-tutorial bgwest$ ember g component -gc -ts welcome
installing component
You passed the '--typescript' flag but there is no TypeScript blueprint available. A JavaScript blueprint will be generated instead.
